# PixelFun

Basically it is QuickJS + SDL2 = PixelFun.

## Usage

Create a function `pixelfun()` that returns a color at a given tick time, and save it inside a javascript file:

```js
function pixelfun(x,y,t) {
  const red = 255;
  const green = (x * 255 / WIDTH)|0;
  const blue = (y * 255 / HEIGHT)|0;
  return [red, green, blue];
}
```

Then, run it:

```sh
pixelfun pixelfun.js
```

Enjoy ðŸ’–
